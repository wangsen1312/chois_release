### Prerequisites 
Please download [SMPL-X](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/index.html) and put the model to ```data/smpl_all_models/```, structure ```data/smpl_all_models/smplx```.

If you would like to generate visualizations, please download [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) first. And modify ```BLENDER_PATH, BLENDER_UTILS_ROOT_FOLDER, BLENDER_SCENE_FOLDER``` in line 8-10 of ```chois_release/manip/vis/blender_vis_mesh_motion.py```. 

Please download all the [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZG-9--RfUWj5oWYnvcONNuRuxaH_Zpw1/view?usp=sharing) and put ```processed_data``` to your desired location ```your_path/processed_data```.  

### Testing: Generating single-window interaction sequences for OMOMO objects.  
Please download pretrained [model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gqw3EHiEMqw1OXqH92Axoc5FJntA_E5x?usp=sharing) and put ```pretrained_models/``` to the root folder. If you'd like to test on 3D-FUTURE objects, please add ```--unseen_objects```. For quantitative evaluation please add ```--for_quant_eval```.
```
sh scripts/test_chois_single_window.sh 
```

### Testing: Generating scene-aware long sequence for OMOMO objects.  
Note that this following command will generate long sequence visualizations in an empty floor. If you'd like to visualize in a 3D scene, please check next instruction below. 
```
sh scripts/test_chois_long_seq_in_scene.sh 
```

### Run visualization for interaction sequence and 3D scenes 
Please run the command to generate long sequence first. This will save human and object meshes to .ply file. If you want to skip the visualization for long sequence in an empty floor, you can change line 2449 in ```trainer_chois.py```, set ```save_obj_only``` to True. 
```
sh scripts/test_chois_long_seq_in_scene.sh 
```
Then edit line 109 and line 110 at ```utils/vis_utils/render_res_w_blender.py``` to call blender and visualize the generated sequence in the given 3D scene.  
```
cd utils/vis_utils
python render_res_w_blender.py 
```

### Training 
Train CHOIS (generating object motion and human motion given text, object geometry, and initial states). Please replace ```--entity``` with your account name. Note that when you first run this script, it need to extract BPS representation for all the sequences and may take more than 1 hour to finish the data processing. It requires about 32G disk space. 
```
sh scripts/train_chois.sh
```

### Computing Evaluation Metrics (FID, R-precision)
We followed prior work on human motion generation (Generating Diverse and Natural 3D Human Motions from Text. CVPR 2022.) for evaluating human motion quality and text-motion consistency. Since the motion distribution in our paper is different from HumanML3D, we trained corresponding feature extractors on OMOMO dataset (Object Motion Guided Human Motion Synthesis. SIGGRAPH Asia 2023.). We provided trained feature extractors [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hGDYEy91Tk7FC1U_8BouhlSp5RQkEJuY?usp=sharing). To run this evaluation, please check the code and modify corresponding paths for feature extractors and the results that you need to evaluate. 
```
cd t2m_eval/
python final_evaluations.py 
```

### Generating new data for scene-aware interaction synthesis.  
We used the following code for generating waypoints in 3D scenes. If you'd like to generate more data, please check ```create_eval_data.py```. 
```
cd utils/create_eval_data/
python create_eval_data.py 
```
